## Day 06

Classic binary search, loved that challange! I'm sure there's also a math way to
do this as well, but this is the CS solution.

I kinda doubted myself I could write binary search from scratch but hey, I did
it.

### Refactoring

For part 1, just making it more succint.
For part 2, I extracted the binary search into a function, though I'm a big
supporter of WET code.
