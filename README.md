# Advent of Code 2023

This is my working directory for advent of code 2023.
This is my second year trying this out, and I chose python again.
I don't have enough free time to learn a new language, and I feel like rust can
only slow me down with correctness. Assumming the input is as described is an
advantage. Beside, a lot of the Pythonic constructs I end up using at work, so I
even come back to check how I've done it for AOC.

> Get to solution as fast as possible, refactor (just a bit) later.
